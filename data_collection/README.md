# Data generation and process for VLSI-LLM
This directory contains the code and guide documents that automates the data collection process.

## Data Generation
TODO (Add the data generation process, (scripts, how to run, etc))

## Data Format
The processed data includes these files:

### `rtl_data/Resyn27k.json`
- Content: 26,532 dictionaries.
- Each dictionary in `Resyn27k.json` has the following mapping:
    1. (string) `"instruction"`: (string) the instruction provided to the LLM to produce the Verilog code of an RTL design.
    2. (string) `"response"`: (string) the Verilog code generated by the LLM based on the given instruction.

### `rtl_data/rtl.json`
- Content: A dictionary that mapps (integer) `rtl_id` to RTL data (dictionary).
- Each RTL data dictionary has the following mapping:
    1. (string) `"verilog"`: (string) the Verilog code for the RTL design.
    2. (string) `"instruction"`: (string) the instruction used to generate the RTL design.
    3. (string)`"description"`: (string) the description generated by Llama3 to explain the RTL design.

### `rtl_data/dataflow_graph/`
- Content: a folder containing python pickle files of the Verilog dataflow graph as a `NetworkX` object.
- The dataflow graph of RTL design `rtl_id` is in `rtl_id.pkl`.

### `netlist_data/netlist.json`
- Content: A dictionary that mapps (integer) `netlist_id` to netlist data (dictionary).
- Each netlist data dictionary has the following mapping:
    1. (string) `"rtl_id"`: (integer) the corresponding RTL design used to generate this netlist.
    2. (string) `"synthesis_efforts"`: (string) the efforts used in genus to synthesize the RTL design (`"{generic_effort}_{mapping_effort}_{optimization_effort}"`).

### `netlist_data/graph/`
- Content: a folder containing python pickle files of the netlist graph as a `NetworkX` object.
- The graph of netlist synthesized from RTL design `rtl_id` with effort parameters `synthesis_efforts` is in `{rtl_id}_{synthesis_efforts}.pkl`.

### `netlist_data/synthesis_log/`
- Content: a folder containing log files of the genus synthesis.
- The synthesis log for synthesizing RTL design `rtl_id` with effort parameters `synthesis_efforts` is in `{rtl_id}_{synthesis_efforts}.log`.

### `netlist_data/verilog/`
- Content: a folder containing Verilog files of the synthesized netlists.
- The netlist Verilog synthesized from RTL design `rtl_id` with effort parameters `synthesis_efforts` is in `{rtl_id}_{synthesis_efforts}.v`.
